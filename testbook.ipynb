    "## Question 1\n",
    "Different brands interpret the size scale differently. A small t-shirt from brand_A can very well be of the same size as a medium t-shirt from brand_B. I would say that this problem is fairly easy to overcome as it is only a matter of metrics. You could for instance map the sizes of the different brands to a sort of “true scale” that holds values that can’t be discussed, i.e. the measurements of the t-shirts. However, this doesn’t solve the problem mentioned in my answer to question 3.\n",

    "## Question 3\n",
    "We have to distinguish between fitting and the preferences of the individual user. A medium t-shirt might fit user X, but she prefers them baggy, so a large t-shirt would actually be the right size for her. It is very hard - if not impossible - to rate a new user in terms of a return-risk score, if we don’t know anything about his or hers preferences. Therefore requesting information from the user about their preferences for different brands sizewise is absolutely crucial - as EasySize already does and knows.\n",
